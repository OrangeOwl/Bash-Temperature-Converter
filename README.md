# Bash-Temperature-Converter
Temperature Converter written in Bash script

## Description
* This is my first foray into bash scripting, and provides the simple function of converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa
* I'm sharing this here so other beginners may be able to glean some insight from it, and so people more knowledgable may provide criticism and advice if they feel so inclined

## How To Run
* Download the .sh file
* Open Bash Terminal in the directory of the file
* Run "chmod u+x ./temp_conv.sh"
* Then run "./temp_conv.sh"
